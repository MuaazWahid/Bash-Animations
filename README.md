# Real Time Linux Animations
A simple bash script that does animations in the terminal.

It utilizes multiple bash tools to enhance the user experience such as:
- awk scripting
- ANSI escape codes (color)
- playing audio and opening an image (end screen thank you)

### Acknowledgements
This script was developed with the help of my partners:
- Mir Ahmad Ali
